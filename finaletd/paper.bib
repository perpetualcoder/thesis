abstract ={A simple method of reference counting applicable to graphs of functional language programs is described. The graph contains strong and weak pointers, but only the strong pointers are counted in the reference counts and by the graph deletion algorithms.It is shown that graphs of functional programs can be constructed in such a way that the sub-graphs got by removing all weak pointers is connected and acyclic. The weak pointers are used only for those recursive references which create cycles in an otherwise acyclic graph. Explicit recursive definitions of functions and data structures may be represented in the graph.The usual graph reduction rules can be implemented so that they do not destroy the required properties of the graph: the sub-graph of strong pointers always remains connected and acyclic. Thus, simple reference counting can be used safely with cyclic graphs of functional programsThis method of storage management has the advantage that is incurs little overhead in either storage space or execution time of beta reduction. Nor is there any excessive increase in the complexity of the algorithm needed for graph reduction. It is less suitable, however, for combinator and supercombinator reduction.},

abstract = "This thesis shows that object-level, trace-driven
simulation can facilitate evaluation of language runtime systems
and reaches new conclusions about the relative performance of
important garbage collection algorithms. In particular, I reach
the unexpected conclusion that mark-and-sweep garbage collection,
when augmented with generations, shows comparable CPU performance
and much better reference locality than the more widely used
copying algorithms. In the past, evaluation of garbage collection
algorithms has been limited by the high cost of implementing the
algorithms. Substantially different algorithms have rarely been
compared in a systematic way.
With the availability of high-performance, low-cost workstations,
trace-driven performance evaluation of these algorithms is now
economical. This thesis describes MARS, a runtime system
simulator that is driven by operations on program objects, and
not memory addresses. MARS has been attached to a commercial
Common Lisp system and eight large Lisp applications are used in
the thesis as test programs. To illustrate the advantages of the
object-level tracing technique used by MARS, this thesis compares
the relative performance of stop-and-copy, incremental, and mark-
and-sweep collection algorithms, all organized with multiple
generations. The comparative evaluation is based on several
metrics: CPU overhead, reference locality, and interactive
availability.
Mark-and-sweep collection shows slightly higher CPU overhead than
stop-and-copy ability (5 percent), but requires significantly less
physical memory to achieve the same page fault rate (30-40 percent).
Incremental collection has very good interactive availability,
but implementing the read barrier on stock hardware incurs a
substantial CPU overhead (30-60 percent). In the future, I will use MARS
to investigate other performance aspects of sophisticated runtime
systems."

	quicker, and that C/C++ is more difficult to maintain.
	Applications written with Java entail easier post-production maintenance than those written with C/C++
	C/C++ applications take 52\% longer to develop and 44\% longer to maintain.
	C/C++ is more expensive than Java is based on actual experience paying for licenses, support, training, updates, and so forth. }

abstract ={A simple method of reference counting applicable to graphs of functional language programs is described. The graph contains strong and weak pointers, but only the strong pointers are counted in the reference counts and by the graph deletion algorithms.It is shown that graphs of functional programs can be constructed in such a way that the sub-graphs got by removing all weak pointers is connected and acyclic. The weak pointers are used only for those recursive references which create cycles in an otherwise acyclic graph. Explicit recursive definitions of functions and data structures may be represented in the graph.The usual graph reduction rules can be implemented so that they do not destroy the required properties of the graph: the sub-graph of strong pointers always remains connected and acyclic. Thus, simple reference counting can be used safely with cyclic graphs of functional programsThis method of storage management has the advantage that is incurs little overhead in either storage space or execution time of beta reduction. Nor is there any excessive increase in the complexity of the algorithm needed for graph reduction. It is less suitable, however, for combinator and supercombinator reduction.},
