\section{Conclusion}
This proposal is aimed at designing a RC based collector that is applicable to
 shared and distributed memory systems efficiently. The contributions would be
 reviving the old RC technique to collect cyclic garbage, design a localized 
 garbage collection algorithm that perform efficiently than the available distributed
 collector. If possible provide fault-tolerance guarantees by designing the
 algorithm with self-stabilization property.
