\section{Conclusion}
This proposal is aimed at designing a high throughput hybrid collector to distributed systems. The contributions up until now includes  reviving the old RC technique to collect cyclic garbage, designing a distributed concurrent garbage collector with centralized queue and future contribution are aimed towards designing a localized, scalable, efficient distributed 
 garbage collection algorithm with necessary guarantees.
